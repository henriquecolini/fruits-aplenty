# Fruits Aplenty!

This was one of my first web application tests, from back when I was learning CSS and, most importantly, Javascript. This is from early 2017. It's a very small and unfinished game that was heavily inspired by [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

The game is quite simple. Your goal is to get as many points as possible. You get points for selling fruit. The fruits you can sell are those on the right panel. You may add fruit by clicking the "Add Fruit" button. 

However, the amount of fruit in your list doesn't change how many points will you get. The only thing that matters is your combo. If you start with a banana, all of your other fruits must be bananas as well. You may discard fruit, but by doing so you get penalties. Too many penalties can make your points even go negative, so avoid discarding. Your combo gives you an exponential amount of points in the end. Your penalties takes an exponential amount of points from you.

In summary:

- Add a fruit
- When the scrolling display reaches your fruit, add another one
- Repeat the last item as long as possible
- When the scroller is going too fast you may want to sell
- Discard fruit wisely

I still enjoy this idea somewhat. I may come back to this game in the future!
